## Descent


### Game Design

Please refer to the game design document ([GDD](./GDD.md)).

### Building

- After cloning this repository `descent` should exist in the same directory as `raylib` itself.  So your file structure should look like this:
    - Some parent directory
        - `raylib`
            - the contents of https://github.com/raysan5/raylib
        - `descent`
            - this `README.md` and all other descent files
- If using Visual Studio, open projects/VS2022/descent.sln
- Select on `descent` in the solution explorer, then in the toolbar at the top, click `Project` > `Set as Startup Project`
- Now you're all set up!  Click `Local Windows Debugger` with the green play arrow and the project will run.
